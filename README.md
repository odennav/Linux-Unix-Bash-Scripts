# Wicked Bash Scripts

Bash scripts modified and tested in virtual machine provisioned with Vagrant.

## Getting Started

To make your learning experience more practical, virtual machines (VMs) have been set up for you to run and test the scripts. [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) was used to create and manage these VMs.

1. **Install Vagrant:**
   If you haven't installed Vagrant yet, you can download it [here](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

2. **Spin Up Linux VMs:**
   ```bash
   vagrant up cool
   ```

3. **Clone the Repository:**
   Clone this repository to your Linux VM to get the scripts and the Vagrant file.
   First install git in VM.
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install git
   git clone https://github.com/odennav/wicked-bash-scripts.git
   cd wicked-bash-scripts/
   ```

4. **Access the VM:**
   ```bash
   vagrant ssh cool

5. **Practice with the Scripts:**

   Open a script file with a text editor of your choice, and type out every line of code for hands-on learning and to understand how it works


6. **Execute the scripts to see the results**:
   ```bash
   bash script_name.sh <arguments>
   ```

   ```bash
   script_name.sh <arguments>
   ```

   ```bash
   ./script_name.sh <arguments>
   ```
